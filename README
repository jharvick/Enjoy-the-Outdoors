# Mountain Information Project

This project provides information about various mountains. It allows users to select a mountain and view details about it, including its name, image, description, elevation, and the sunrise and sunset times at its location.

## Features

- **Mountain Selection**: Users can select a mountain to view information about.
- **Mountain Information Display**: Displays information about the selected mountain, including its name, image, description, elevation, and the sunrise and sunset times at its location.
- **Sunrise and Sunset Times**: Fetches and displays the sunrise and sunset times at the location of the selected mountain using the Sunrise-Sunset API.

## How to Use

### For `mtn_info.html`:

1. Open `mtn_info.html` in your web browser.
2. Select a mountain from the dropdown menu.
3. The information about the selected mountain, including name, image, elevation, effort level, description, coordinates, and sunset time, will be displayed on the page.

### For `ntl_parks.html`:

1. Open `ntl_parks.html` in your web browser.
2. Select a national park from the dropdown menu.
3. The information about the selected national park, including name, image, description, and other relevant details, will be displayed on the page.

## Interesting Code

One interesting piece of JavaScript code used in this project is the `getSunsetForMountain` function. This function uses the Fetch API to make a request to the Sunrise-Sunset API and get the sunrise and sunset times for a specific location. Here's the code:

```javascript
async function getSunsetForMountain(lat, lng){
    let response = await fetch(`https://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json?lat=${lat}&lng=${lng}&date=today`);
    let data = await response.json();
    return data;
}

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Sunrise-Sunset API

## Future Improvements

- Add more mountains to the selection.
- Improve the UI/UX of the information display.
